# Qakbot IOCs - Highly suspicious newly registered domains
# Qakbot leverages advanced techniques to evade detection and hamper manual analysis of the threat. QakBot attacks typically include a malicious attachment to a phishing email. Often these are bare Microsoft Word documents attached to the spam email. 
# This particular campaign features a ZIP file; within the ZIP attachment is a Word document that includes macros within the document. These macros execute a PowerShell script that then downloads the Qakbot payload from specific URLs.
