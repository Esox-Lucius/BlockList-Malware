# Playing around with BlackLists/BlockLists - Threats are according to otx.alienvault.com

- USE AT OWN RISK!

- I do not take any responsibility for wrong usage: the action, amount, or mode of using

- When I've caught up with the work on list [Malware - Domains Only (Mixed)] - I will start trimming the different lists for duplicates.

- The list [Malware - Crypto Mining Pool Hosts] is a huge 2.28 MB (75070 lines) file.

- Every link reported should be considered harmefull and could result in an unwanted malware download.

- I use these lists on my Pi-HoleÂ® - to play around with!
